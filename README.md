# Requirement-Analysis
This repository includes detailed problem definitions, goals, user personas, feature epics, user stories, acceptance criteria, and visuals, forming the foundation for product planning, development, and future enhancements as the BMS grows from concept to implementation.

What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a foundational phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where business needs are examined, clarified, and translated into actionable technical requirements. It involves close collaboration between stakeholders such as product managers, end-users, designers, and engineers to ensure the product solves the right problem and delivers measurable value.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Ensures all stakeholders clearly understand what needs to be built, reducing confusion and scope creep.
2. Saves time and cost by detecting gaps early, minimising rework and development delays.
3. Aligns the product with real user needs, leading to higher satisfaction and adoption while ensuring quality.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
1. Requirement Gathering:
Collecting initial information about business needs and user expectations from stakeholders, existing systems, and market research.
2. Requirement Elicitation:
Engaging directly with users and stakeholders through interviews, workshops, surveys, and observation to uncover detailed needs, constraints, and hidden requirements.
3. Requirement Documentation:
Formally recording requirements in clear, structured artifacts such as PRDs, user stories, use cases, diagrams, and functional specifications for team reference.
4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling:
Examining and refining requirements to ensure they are feasible, unambiguous, prioritized, and well understood. This may include creating models like data flows, ERDs, and process diagrams.
5. Requirement Validation:
Confirming that documented requirements align with business objectives and user needs through stakeholder reviews, prototyping, and acceptance criteria verification.
