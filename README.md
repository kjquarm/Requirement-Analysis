What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a foundational phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where business needs are examined, clarified, and translated into actionable technical requirements. It involves close collaboration between stakeholders such as product managers, end-users, designers, and engineers to ensure the product solves the right problem and delivers measurable value.
